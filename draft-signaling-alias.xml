<abstract>
<t>This document suggests a light-weight and semantics-free way to
signal, in the DNS itself, that a domain name is actually an alias of
another one (and therefore that they are member of the same bundle).</t>
<t>REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION: this document should be discussed in the
dnsbundled maiing list <eref
target="https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/bundled-domain-names"/>. The
source of the document, as well as a list of open issues, is currently
kept <eref
target="https://github.com/bortzmeyer/ietf-signaling-alias">at

  <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction and background">
    <t>
      There are often requests that a domain name be regarded as a
      mere alias for another one, so it can be substituted by this
      another domain. The reasons to do so are many <xref
      target="I-D.yao-bundled-name-problem-statement"/> and not
      discussed here.
    </t>
    <t>The problem is much more complicated than it seems and it is
    difficult to imagine a solution that will satisfy every use
    case. We do not attempt to define such a solution. Instead, we
    choose the path of least resistance and propose just to signal, in
    the DNS, this "aliasing" relationship. This signaling is not
    accompanied by a specification of the semantics of this
    relationship, and this is a deliberate design decision.</t>
    <t>Existing solutions are insufficient: CNAMEs (<xref
    target="RFC1034"/>, section 3.6.2) only alias one domain name, not
    a subtree, and cannot be at the apex of a domain, where most
    people would want it (<xref target="cloudflare-cname"/>). DNAMEs (<xref
    target="RFC6672"/>) alias a subtree but not the owner name, only
    its subdomains. BNAMEs (<xref target="I-D.yao-dnsext-bname"/>) are
    not yet standardized and raise several issues (TODO describe).</t>
    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>"Client": any program that will act on the basis of the
      DNS information described in this document.</t>
  <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
   target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
      </section>
  </section>
  
  <section anchor="rrtype" title="The ALIAS RR type">
    <t>We define a new RR type, ALIAS. Its owner name is the apex of a
    domain, and its RDATA is the name of the domain which is
    substitutable to this one. For instance, this says that
    foo.example is actually an alias of bar.example:
    <figure>
      <artwork>
$ORIGIN foo.example.
@       IN  ALIAS bar.example.
      </artwork>
    </figure></t>
    <t>TODO formal presentation format</t>
    <t>TODO binary format</t>
    <t>The new RR type has no special processing requirment. An
    authoritative name server MAY send it in the additional section of
    a response, when the QNAME is a domain name which has such an
    ALIAS.</t>
    <t>An alternative to a new record type is described in <xref target="txt"/>.</t>
  </section>
  <section title="Usage">
    <t>The alias is for a subtree, that's why it is always at the apex
    of a domain. TODO what if there is a subdelegation?</t>
    <t>The general idea is that clients will use this aliasing
    information as they please. By "clients", we mean any program
    using this DNS resource record. It can be a Web browser trying to
    visit a site, an EPP server trying to determine if a transfer is
    possible (or if it would break a bundle), a HTTP server trying to
    find out the list of values it will accept in the Host: header,
    etc.</t>
    <t>This lack of semantics is a deliberate feature; there are so many
    use cases for "bundled" domain names that it is difficult, at the
    present time, to design a solution to satisfy them all. We
    therefore limit ourselves to signaling an intent, not to specify
    what to do with it.</t>
  </section>
  <section title="Reverse aliasing">
    <t>Some persons may want to have "reverse aliasing", either to
    easily find out the domains aliasing to them, or to "authorize"
    the aliasing. (It is not clear yet if it is a good idea. In the
    current DNS, decentralized and loosely coupled, nothing prevents
    someone to point a CNAME at you, and you cannot even know it.)</t>
    <t>To do so, we define a second RR type, SAILA, to specify a
    domain pointing at you:
    <figure>
      <artwork>
$ORIGIN bar.example.
@       IN  SAILA foo.example.
      </artwork>
    </figure></t>
  </section>
  <section title="Deployability">
    <t>Because this document does not change the behavior of the name
    servers (either recursive or authoritative), it can be deployed on
    the existing infrastructure, providing name servers and DNS
    provisioning systems follow <xref target="RFC3597"/>. If they
    don't, the alternative in <xref target="txt"/> may be considered.</t>
    <t>Adding this aliasing information to the DNS is extremely cheap
    and without any drawbacks. The author hope it will be done, even
    without waiting clients that wil consume this information.</t>
    <t>It remains to be seen if it will be easier to upgrade the
    clients (to use this information) or the name servers (which is a
    requirment of other proposals like BNAME <xref target="I-D.yao-dnsext-bname"/>).</t>
  </section>
  
<section title="IANA Considerations">
<t>TODO register one (or two) new RR types. <xref target="RFC6895"/></t>
</section>

<section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
<t>No DNS security issues are expected since no specific action is
mandated for the client.</t>
<t>A client is responsible of what it decides to do with the aliasing
information.</t>
<t>A security-conscious client MAY decide to act on this aliasing
    information only if it is validated with DNSSEC.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="impl" title="Implementation status - RFC EDITOR: REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION">

<t>This section records the status of known implementations of the
protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in <xref
target="RFC7942"/>. The description of implementations in this section
is intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in
progressing drafts to RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any
individual implementation here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.
Furthermore, no effort has been spent to verify the information
presented here that was supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not
intended as, and must not be construed to be, a catalog of available
implementations or their features.  Readers are advised to note that
other implementations may exist.</t>
<t>According to <xref target="RFC7942"/>, "this will allow reviewers
and working groups to assign due consideration to documents that have
the benefit of running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable
experimentation and feedback that have made the implemented protocols
more mature.  It is up to the individual working groups to use this
information as they see fit".</t>
<t>No implementation known at this time.</t>

<section anchor="txt" title="A TXT alternative to the new RR type">
  <t>In theory, a new RR type such as ALIAS works everywhere, thanks
  to <xref target="RFC3597"/>. In practice, while most name servers
  won't have any problem with it, many 
  domain name provisioning systems will have trouble handling
  ALIAS. Therefore, we suggest here an alternative: a TXT record under
  the subdomain _alias. The example above would become:
    <figure>
      <artwork>
$ORIGIN foo.example.
_alias  IN  TXT bar.example.
      </artwork>
    </figure> TODO IAB RFC on the proper use of TXT records</t>
